// make tag and array then h1 = array[1], h2= array[2]
// add pseudo-code to function when made
// row = horizontal, column = vertical

//function counter for how many instances 1,2,3,4 has what is there count, var count_1=0

//function most instances: order of instances count_1,... which one has the highest number, this is the order in which you put the number in

//! use a class for function N,and Y:
// goes through position 1,2,3,4... to 16
// if position has 1-4 number move to next position
//when at each position it goes from column in row to find number n
// if row and column do not have number n label as N, change position from X to Y
// Y this indicates that you can put number Y in position,
//
// if row and column does have number n label as N, change position from X to N
// N this indicates that you can put number -N- in position,

//!put number n in a position
